        <h3>11 years of experience across markets like India, Malaysia & Singapore.</h3>
        <h4>Designer by choice. Art Director by profession.</h4>
        <p>In 2007, Gary stepped out of art school and into BBDO Malaysia.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, that year, his work for Jeep won every metal worth its weight making it the most awarded campaign in the world.</p>
        <p>4 years and a short flight later, he landed at DDB Singapore. Picking more metal for ground-breaking, category-shifting, media agnostic work along the way.</p>
        <p>In his 8-yr career, he has worked for clients like KFC, Mini Cooper, Visa, Pepsi, Olympus, DHL, Fedex,  Snickers, Guinness and most recently, the UN.</p>
        <p>These days, he spends most of his time at BBDO Singapore doing ads.</p>
        <p>And in his free time, he's doing, well, more ads.</p>
        <p>If it wasn't advertising, he'd be involved in something more respectable. Like nouveau-porn.</p>
