  			<p>In 2007, Gary stepped out of art school and into BBDO Malaysia. That was also the year when his work for Jeep was the most awarded campaign in the world. 4 years and a short flight later, he landed at DDB Singapore. Picking more metal for ground-breaking, category-shifting, media-agnostic campaigns along the way.</p>
        <p>In his 8-yr career, he has worked with clients like KFC, MINI, Pepsi, Olympus, Fedex, Guinness and most recently, the United Nations. At 29, he's probably the youngest guy whose work made it into Clio's Hall of Fame. These days, he spends most of his time at BBDO Singapore. If it wasn't advertising, he'd be doing something more respectable, like amateur porn.</p>
